# InfoPath transformation guidance #
In this section of the PnP Transformation repository you'll find IP that will help you transform InfoPath forms to SharePoint Add-In model based equivalents. This section is organized as follows:
- **[Guidance](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Transformation/tree/dev/InfoPath/Guidance)** - contains documentation on InfoPath limitations in Office 365 and describes remediation models and approaches
- **[Reference](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Transformation/tree/dev/InfoPath/Reference)** - contains sample InfoPath forms (e.g. employee registration form) that show common InfoPath customizations and patterns. In the samples section we'll show how these common InfoPath customizations and patterns can be realized using alternative (SharePoint Add-In) developments
- **[Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Transformation/tree/dev/InfoPath/Samples)** - here we collect the various (SharePoint Add-In) samples. These samples mimic the capabilities of the InfoPath employee registration form which you can find in the Reference section
- **[Migration](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Transformation/tree/dev/InfoPath/Migration)** - once you transform an InfoPath form to a SharePoint Add-In you also need to migrate the data from InfoPath XML to a new model. This section provides you more input on how to that
